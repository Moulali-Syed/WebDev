/*
In 1995 Brendan created Javascript - in 10 days

first named mocha , then livescript - then to javascript 

Then in netscape became popular 

then microsoft thought similar created jscript

there comes a reason for standardising the language 
so ecma script made a standard

in 1997 , ES1 released ... ES5:2009(lots of new features)
ES6(ES2015) [biggest update in history of js - modern javascript]

members of tc39 decided to release new features every year

javascript is backward compatiable , but not forward compatiable[suppose someone is not updating there browser]

we write modern code - then use babel , to transpile our es6 code to es5 code ,so old browsers support our code


Use  vs code for web development
install live server


ctrl+shift+j - opens console in browser
