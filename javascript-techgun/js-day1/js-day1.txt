javascript HelloWorld:

software needed
We need browser [chrome], a text editor [vs code is recommended]

We can create a .js file to write javascript code 

We can have multiple javascript files in a website

We can write javascript code in chrome console 

We can write javascript  code inside html file

 <body>
    <h1>JS Tutorial</h1>

    <script>
      alert('Hello World');
    </script>
  </body>


  we can write script tag inside body or head or in both , also we can have any number of script tags


  We can js code in a .js file and link it to html file
  code in script.js

  alert('Hello World');

  linking script.js to html file
    <body>
    <h1>JS Tutorial</h1>
    <script src="../js-day1/js/script.js"></script>
  </body>

  We can have multiple script tags in the body and head

  If we want the js file to be executed before the html file , place it in head tag , else place it body tag
  If we use external javascript file , if once the website is loaded the js file will be cached and for further
  loading of website it will be faster

   <script async src="../js-day1/js/script.js"></script>  //download and execute where ever found[default]
   async in script tag , it is default , though we mention or not , when it encounters this line it will execute the js file [default]

    <script defer src="../js-day1/js/script.js"></script> //download and execute after loading complete html
    defer - this when used it will download js file after reading the complete html file


    We can write into html file
    document.getElementById('h').innerHTML = 'Moulali';

     <h2 id="h"></h2>

     We can also write using below - but the script should not be defer
     document.write('Hello From Write');
     document.write doesnot work with defer in script tag
     document.write works based on the position of the script tag placed in the html file 

To write in console:
console.log('Hello Wolrd');

******** To write multiple lines of code inside the chrome console press shift+Enter *******
